# Harvard Museum API
This mini project was to practice using new API's and completing fetch requests. This small application has one button which will request and display ten random images from the Harvard Museum API.

This example will display ten images at a time in two columns.

# Requirements
An API Key issued from the Harvard Art Museum is required to successfully use this application. You can send a request to obtain an API Key at: https://harvardartmuseums.org/collections/api

A variable named "API_KEY" should be created in a separate file, "./api.js", to experiment with a working copy of this repository.
